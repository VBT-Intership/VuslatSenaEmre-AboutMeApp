       Hello, I am Vuslat Sena.
\n\nI am doing this application within the scope of an internship that we have realized for the first time. I am a 3rd grade student in Computer Engineering.
\n\nAlthough I am new to coding, I really love this job and I believe that I will move myself to a much better point in 1 year.
\n\nI had the chance to participate in various organizations before. I love traveling, seeing new places and working in a team.
        \n\n
